Essential players at the start of seasons, and how to identify them.

Top half team. Gaining form towards the end of last season.
EPL experience must, if not top half team. 


2013/14
Bargains: Ramsey, Jay Rodriguez
Ramsey was gaining form towards the end of 2012/13. Good stats, top 6 team.
JRod played alongside Rickie Lambert in 2012/13. SOT finished 14th. In 2013/14 SOT finished 8th. 
Ramsey from start of season.


2014/15
Bargains: Harry Kane
3 goals and 2 assists in last 6 matches of 2013/14 EPL. 8 goals and 5 assists in 8 matches in 2013/14 U-21 PL2.
Kane from start of season.

2015/16
Bargains: Mahrez, Vardy, Alli, Payet
Leicester, just because it was. Even then, Mahrez and Vardy had more than 2000 minutes of EPL experience. 
Vardy scored 4 goals and 4 assists in last 10 matches of 2014/15. Extremely successful in 2013/14 Championship.
Alli played 2014/15 with MK Dons in League One, 16 goals and 9 assists in 39 matches.
Payet played 2014/15 in Ligue 1, 7 goals and 21 assists in 36 matches. WestHam finished 7th.
Vardy, Mahrez, Payet from start of season.

2016/17
Bargains: King, Son
King scored 4 goals and 2 assists in last 10 matches of 2015/16. Required many more EPL minutes before he started scoring. Prior success.
Son had 1000 minutes of PL experience with Spurs in 2015/16. Prior experience and success in Bundesliga.

2017/18
Bargains: Milivojevic, Gross
Milivojevic had prior EPL experience in 2016/17. Required more experience early 2017/18 before starting to score. Set piece duties.
Gross is the anomaly here. No prior EPL experience. Not a top half team. Did well in Bundesliga though.

2018/19 will see some bargain options.

6.5m
=============
Murray: Maximum reached.
Chris Wood: Nailed. 6 goals and 1 assist in last 10 matches of 2017/18. Extremely successful in 2016/17 Championship. Burnley will probably finish top half.
Mitrovic: Wait and see. No EPL experience last year. Will take time.
Perez: Nailed. 6 goals and 1 assist in last 10 matches of 2017/18. Never scored more than 10 goals in any English season.
Chicarito: Maximum reached.
King: Proven decent. Started all 3 previous seasons slowly, ended with a lot of goals. 
Welbeck: Maximum reached.
Benteke: Maximum reached.

Richarlison: Nailed. EPL experienced, successful in early 2017/18. Everton will probably finish top half.

** Buy Wood at start (similar profile to JRod, Vardy, King)

Top 6 teams:
ManCity -- Rotation
Chelsea -- Who will be in the first team?
Arsenal -- Who will be in the first team?
ManUntd -- Avoid, going to crash
Spurs   -- Eriksen (others like Kane, Alli, Vertonghen, Alderweireld will return late. Son going to Asian Games. Can't trust Lamela and co.)
Liv     -- Salah, Mane, Firmino, Keita, Robertson, VvD, Allison

Then a few more:
Everton
Palace 
Wolves



==================

2013/14 - My first season of FPL. Michu, Walcott, Mata, Suarez and Baines were hyped before the season. Suarez performed, and oh dear! Baines also returned good points, but Coleman was much better value. Terry, Yaya, Gerrard, Ramsey, Hazard and Lallana scored the points. Ramsey and JRod were the value players.
Beginning of season punt: I was stuck with Ricky van Wolfswinkel for more than 10 GWs.

2014/15 - With Suarez gone from the EPL, Sanchez, Aguero, Costa, Rooney, Sterling were some of the big names. Everyone had Barkley. Back in those days, he was like Richarlison. Bojan Krkic, Soldado, Caulker, Adam Johnson were hyped as great value options. Some also had Balotelli. But, Harry Kane stole the show. Ivanovic, Terry, Jagielka, Hazard, Sanchez, Silva, Cazorla and Austin scored the points.
Beginning of season punt: I had Sigurdsson, and quite obviously, it was my best ever season. I also had Soldado.

2015/16 - Apart from the previous year's options of Kane, Rooney, Aguero, Sterling and others, players who were considered in these parts were Depay, Redmond, Defoe, Wilson, Pelle, Cazorla and once-again-back-to-fitness Walcott. Sigurdsson was still 7.5m and Dusan Tadic was also in many teams. And this year, we saw the best EPL ever. Glory to Leicester. The rise of Mahrez and Vardy. Unkike last years, there were few who started with Mahrez / Vardy. Dele Alli, Payet and Mane also came into prominence this year. Koscielny, Fuchs and Bellerin excelled in defence. 
Experiment gone wrong: I had Graziano Pell√®. Enough said.


2016/17
Hyped: Stones, Terry, JRod, Gray, Long, Negredo, Snodgrass, Downing
Bargains: Joshua King, Barkley, Son Heung-Min
Andre Gray played fantastic in the Championship but fell short in the Premier League.
Joshua King 

2017/18
Hyped: Ince, Ritchie, Albrighton, Tadic, Milivojevic, Phillips, Gross, Atsu, Choupo-Moting, Fer
Bargains: Milivojevic, Gross, Richarlison (initially)
